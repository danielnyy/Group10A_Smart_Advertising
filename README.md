# Group10A_Smart_Advertising
My final year project with two other members, Chong Jia Voon and Justin Ang Wei-Shen. 
It is a project to display advertisement based on age and gender using a classification algorithm with a webcam.
We are students from Monash University Malaysia. Attached is a pdf file named User Guide, to understand how to use the program.
